# COURSE_RECOMMENDER_SYSTEM

"Designed a dynamic course recommender system tailored for employees, employing a dual recommendation approach. Leveraging popular courses as a foundation, the system seamlessly combines content-based recommendation strategies with user ratings and subscriber counts.

Integrated a curated selection of popular courses to cater to broad employee interests and industry trends. This forms the foundation for initial recommendations, ensuring relevance and alignment with professional development needs.

Implemented a content-based recommendation system that analyzes course content, aligning it with individual user profiles. This fine-tuned approach enhances personalization, delivering courses that match each employee's skill set, career goals, and learning preferences.

Incorporated user ratings and subscriber counts as key metrics to refine recommendations. By considering the collective wisdom of user feedback and gauging the popularity of courses through subscriber counts, the system continually optimizes suggestions for an enhanced learning experience.

The course recommender system not only streamlines the discovery of relevant content but also fosters a tailored learning experience, empowering employees to engage with courses that align with their professional growth objectives. This innovative approach contributes to a culture of continuous learning within the organization."
